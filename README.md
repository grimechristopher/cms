## Description

Course and Faculty Management System is a Web Application with the purpose of allowing educational organizations to efficiently organize and manage their courses and faculty. The web application is a password secured, database driven website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The design of the site is responsive, mobile first guidelines. Public users can view the courses the university offers as well as which instructors teach them. Courses can be filtered by term and subject. Users that are logged in and have the correct permissions can edit/add/delete courses, departments, and instructors in the database. Site Admins can import files containing information about multiple courses as well as export the courses in the database to a csv file. The site admin can also edit the other userâ€™s permissions. Admins can easily view if there are conflicts in a faculty member's schedule. 

Developed using the framework found in *PHP & MySQL Novice to Ninja.* The text book was used in the course *CMPS 320: Internet Apps Development.* In the course I learned basic PHP functions all the way to developing and modifying PHP frameworks. Skills I learned were how to implement MVC pattern, routing, templating, handling HTTP requests, authentication, and access a SQL database. 

Throughout the completion of my senior project I gained useful and practical knowledge about programming and application development. Mainly how important sticking to a consistant naming style is and keeping code organized. This was my first experience following the stages of development from gathering information and planning to testing and launching the completed web application. I became a profiecient PHP developer through completion of this project.
